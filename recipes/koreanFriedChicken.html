        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Korean fried chicken is a unique take on the classic fried chicken, renowned for its crispy, thin coating and tender, juicy meat inside. The chicken is usually double-fried, which gives it an extra-crunchy texture that holds up well even when coated in flavorful sauces. The most popular variety is yangnyeom chicken, which is tossed in a sticky, sweet, and spicy sauce made with ingredients like gochujang (Korean chili paste), garlic, soy sauce, and sugar. It’s often served with pickled radish on the side, balancing the heat with a refreshing crunch. What sets Korean fried chicken apart is the contrast between the crispy exterior and the moist interior, making every bite an addictive combination of flavors and textures.</p>
