                Hello! I hope you enjoyed the recipes linked above! As a NYC native, I've been around delicious food all my life. I'm always down to go to see a new restaurant in Brooklyn, or go through a Flushing food crawl! Learning HTML so far has been a blast,
                and I can't wait to learn even more!
