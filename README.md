# odin-recipe
This is a website to act as a recipe book for my favorite recipes! It's the first project I've done in HTML. The skills I hope do demonstrate are
- Homepage
- Subpages
- Images (JPEGs, GIFs, PNGs, and SVGs)
- Bold and Italics
- Unordered lists and ordered lists
- Different size headings
- Utlizing paragraph tags
